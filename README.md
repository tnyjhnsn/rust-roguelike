# rust-roguelike
## Some notes
This project was my attempt to create a client/server version of a Roguelike. However, the primary objective was just to learn some Rust.

I used the fabulous tutorial at http://bfnightly.bracketproductions.com/rustbook/chapter_0.html as a base to create the server. This communicated via websocket with a client written using the Yew famework and compiled to wasm for consumption in a browser.

## Putting this project on ice
I got a fair amount of functionality completed that I was happy with but eventually realised that this particular approach using plain old HTML and CSS would not be satisfactory to achieve all the goals I had in mind. For now, I am putting this project on hold and moving to design something else, probably using using ggez or canvas.

It will still be a client/server app because I would like to experiment with a multiuser Roguelike (yeah... I know I am stretching the boundaries of the genre). It would also be great to incorporate some kind of cryptocurrency into the game design but I don't have any firm ideas about how to achieve this yet.

Thanks.
